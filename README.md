## Short Project Description
Home safety is the number one priority of homeowners. Different detectors such as smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors have helped with home safety and disaster prevention. However, the design of such detectors have not been changed for many years. The goal of our project is to modernize such detectors that contribute to home safety using Internet of Things technology. For this project, we will add a smoke detector which can detect smoke and other harmful gasses, a water level detector which can detect any flooding or leakage in the house, as well as a temperature and humidity sensor. These detectors will work together to detect any abnormal conditions in the house to prevent any disaster or further damage to both the residents properties and themselves. We will connect all these detectors to the internet which will allow us to alert homeowners of any potentially harmful events that could happen to their house even when they are out of the house. This would provide the homeowners the ability to alert authorities to prevent any further damage to their property or residents on the property. Such a system could prevent any disaster caused by appliances such as water boilers, furnaces, stoves and from unexpected situations such as a short circuit, water pipe leakage, etc.
